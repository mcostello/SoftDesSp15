Top 5 longest ORFs:

1. type III secretion system protein SpaS [Salmonella enterica]
Required for surface presentation of invasion plasmid antigens; required for invasion and for secretion of the three ipa proteins
2. antigen presentation protein SpaN
involved in the surface presentation of antigens needed for the invasion of Salmonella into host cells
3. surface presentation of antigens protein SpaO
associated with type III secretion and virulence
4. ATP synthase
invasion protein InvC; necessary for efficient entry of S.typhimurium into cultured epithelial cells; probable catalytic subunit of a protein translocase
5. surface presentation of antigens protein SpaR
similar to 3
