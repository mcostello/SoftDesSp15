Machine Learning Questions

1. On the curve of % used data vs. accuracy, the accuracy of each model increases as the percent data used in training the model is increased.
2. Generally, the noisiest part of the curve is the area between 10% and 40%; this section has limited guarantees of success, where the algorithm knows just enough data to make a bad guess.
3. Around 20-30 trials are necessary for a nice, consistently smooth curve.
4. By increasing the rate of logistic regression (making C larger, i.e., C=10**-1) the program works more slowly but becomes vastly more accurate. Alternately, as C gets smaller, it becomes less effective.
